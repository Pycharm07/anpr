Automatic Number Plate Recognition
This is the project which is close enough to detect a number plate from an image of a car, with proper lighting and close angle capturence.
This whole project contains two images that it successfully parsed and detected the number plate.
To get the text from an image you need the pytesseract module to install externally in your system. Watch videos for that.
This project also contain an environment with jupyter nootbook to access from cmd in windows
To access to virtual env in windows:
    cd env/Scripts
    activate.bat
    cd ../../
Now you can run the project or you can go to jupyter by giving this command: jupyter notebook and run it.(plotting is commented)
I have also fixed the image name to run the other image you need to rename the image name by car.jpg
